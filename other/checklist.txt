	-a -A   C   	with and without '.' and '..'       
		-aR -AR
	-G	C?	enable colorized output
	-1      !   	output per line                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	-C      !      	multi-column output (default to a terminal)
	-x	!	the same as -C, except that the output sorted across (by lines)
	-lh	!	uses sufixes for bytes, kilobytes, etc
	-m	!	list files across the pages, separated by comas
	-S	!	sort by size
	-lT	!	displays complete time info
	-F	!	display
				'/' after dir names 
				'*' after exec. files 
				'@' after symbolic links
				'=' after sockets
				'%' after whiteout
				'|' after each that is FIFO

	-f 	!	output not sorted
	-i		prints files serial number (inode number)
	-c		use time when file status was last changed with -t and -l
	-t		sort by time modified
		-lc -tc -ltc -lt
	-u		use time of last access instead of las modification of -t or -l
	-U		use time of file creation -||-
	-d		directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively)
	-n		display user and group ID's numerically, turns on -l
	-lO 		include the file flags
	-o		list in long format, but omit the group id
	-r 		reverse the order of the sort

	-g	?	only for POSIX: displays group name, user name suppressed
	-H	?	symbolic links on the command line are followed
	-e	?	print the ACL if present
	-B      ?   	printing non-printable characters        
	-q 	?	force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the character '?' (Default when output to terminal)                                                                                                                	-b      ?   	as -B, but use C escape codes whenever possible    
	-v	?	force unedited printing of non-graphic characters (default for non-terminal output)
	-W	?	display	whiteouts when scanning directories 
	-w 	?	force raw printing of non-printable characters
	-l@     ?	extended attribute keys and sizes
	-s	?	display the number of file system blocks actually used by each file
	-sk 	?	print the file size allocation in kilobytes, not blocks
	-L	? 	follow all symbolic links to final target and list the file or directory the link references rather than the link itself
	-P	?	if argument is a symbolic link, list the link itself rather than the object the link references. Cancels -H and -L
	
OVERRIDES (last one determines the format used):
	-1 -C -x -l
	-c -u
	-B -b -w -q
	-H -L -P

SORTING FLAGS
	default		by name
	-S		by size
	-tc		by time when file status was last changed
	-t		by time modified
	-tu		by time last access
	-tU		by time of file creation
